# opensource.crowdstrike.com

### Running locally

once `cd`d into the repo, and after having run `pnpm install`, the app, which lives in the `site` directory, can be ran via `pnpm start`

### Updating the featured projects

Same as the contributin steps, except your changes involve `config.yaml`.

This generates the json files that the "app" will read for both featured projects and *all* projects.
